      <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Climate Change</strong> <em>refers</em> to a long-term shift in
        the planet's weather patterns and average temperatures. Global
        temperatures rose about 1.98°F (1.1°C) from 1901 to 2020, but climate
        change refers to more than an increase in temperature. It also includes
        sea level rise, changes in weather patterns like drought and flooding,
        and much more. Things that we depend upon and value — water, energy,
        transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health —
        are experiencing the effects of a changing climate. We now know that
        man-made climate change is real and that it poses a great threat to the
        planet and its inhabitants. Current data suggest that we need to reduce
        greenhouse-gas emissions in developed countries by at least 80% by 2050
        in order to have a chance of staying below an average temperature rise
        of over 2ºC.

      <p>
        The climate on Earth has been changing since it was formed which is 4.5
        billion years ago. Till now, natural factors have been the cause of
        these changes which include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, shifts in
        the earth's crust, etc. Scientists now agree that humans cause climate
        change. Many of us think climate change mainly means warmer
        temperatures, however, this is just the beginning of the story. Because
        the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one
        area can influence changes in all others. The consequences of climate
        change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity,
        severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice,
        catastrophic storms, and declining biodiversity.
